## Project Description
MCrouchet is an e-commerce Android application designed for crochet enthusiasts and artisans. It provides a platform for users to discover and purchase a variety of crochet-related products, patterns, and potentially even connect with other crocheters. The app offers a seamless shopping experience with features for user registration, secure login, product browsing, order management, and payment processing.

## User Experience

- **Authentication:** New users can easily create an account through the `UserRegistration` activity, while existing users can securely log in using the `UserLogin` activity.
  
- **Product Discovery:** The core of the app likely revolves around the `MainActivity`, where users can browse and discover a wide range of crochet products, patterns, and potentially even connect with other crocheters within a community forum or marketplace.
  
- **Order Management:** Users can add desired items to their cart and proceed to checkout, with the `SuccessPay` activity indicating a successful transaction. This suggests a secure and integrated payment gateway for a smooth purchasing experience.
  
- **Admin Panel:** The `AdminHomeActivity` provides a dedicated interface for administrators to manage the app's content, including product listings, user accounts, and order processing. This ensures efficient backend operations and content control.
